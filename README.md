# zk-SNARK Verification with Hardhat and Circom

🔒 This project demonstrates how to create and verify zk-SNARK proofs using the Hardhat framework, Circom circuit language, and Ethereum smart contracts. The project includes a Circom circuit that implements logical gates (AND, OR, and NOT) and showcases how to generate a proof for a specific input combination. The proof is subsequently verified using a Solidity smart contract deployed to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Hardhat (`npm install --save-dev hardhat`)
- Dotenv (`npm install dotenv`)

## Installation

1. 📥 Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory.
3. ⚙️ Install project dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install dotenv
  ## Steps to Complete the Project
1. 🛠 Write the Circuit: Implement the zkSNARK circuit using Circom. The circuit incorporates the specified logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) and defines input signals (a and b), intermediate signals (x and y), and an output signal (q).

2. 📝 Compile the Circuit: Utilize Hardhat-Circom to compile the circuit, which generates the necessary circuit intermediaries.

3. 🔑 Generate a Proof: With the compiled circuit and specific input values (e.g., A=0 and B=1), generate a zk-SNARK proof that proves the knowledge of inputs yielding a specific output.

4. 🚀 Deploy the Verifier Contract: Deploy a Solidity verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. This contract verifies the proofs generated by the circuit.

5. ✅ Verify the Proof On-Chain: Call the verifyProof() method on the deployed verifier contract, passing the generated proof as input. Ensure that the method's output is true to confirm successful proof verification.

 ## Circuit Implementation
🔌 The zkSNARK circuit is implemented in the circuit.circom file. This file defines the logic for the logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) and specifies input and output signals, as well as intermediate signals used to store gate outputs.
## How to Use
To run the circuit and generate the proof, follow these steps:

1. 📥 Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. 🚀 Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. ⚙️ Install the required dependencies using npm install.
4. 📝 Write the circuit logic in the circuit.circom file.
5. ⚙️ Compile the circuit using Hardhat-Circom: npx hardhat circom.
6. 🔑 Generate the proof: npx hardhat generate-proof.
7. 🚀 Deploy the verifier contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai.
8. ✅ Verify the proof on-chain by calling the verifyProof() method on the deployed verifier contract.
